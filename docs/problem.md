### Problem

Alternate text is an attribute embedded in digital content, such as a web page or PDF, that describes a photo or graphic. As such, alt text is critical for those with disabilities because it represents the function and appearance of a picture or drawing they cannot see. People who publish images to the Internet frequently do not include alt text, making these images incomprehensible for those relying on screen readers or with poor Internet connectivity. According to the Twitter accessibility team, only .06% of images on its website are accessible. We hope to improve the status quo of missing alt text on the Internet through our solution. Our mission is to make the Internet more inclusive by effortlessly receiving alt text on the user's end.

Our Solution,
Bigger Picture allow screen readers to interpret information about on-page pictures for the benefit of those who are blind, visually disabled, or otherwise unable to see the images on the page.

If an image file cannot be loaded, alt text will be shown in its stead.

Alt text gives greater picture context/descriptions to search engine crawlers, assisting them in correctly indexing and ranking an image in image search. It also gives contextual information about the page's content to search engines.
